`MeasuredOTF` holds an array of measured data with information about the dimensions of the measurement. This allows
you to make conversions to other representations of a transfer function such as a PSF and to use interpolations to
sample the OTF at arbitrary locations not included in the initial measurement (in general to use the measurements 
similarly to how one could use a model). This can be useful for using the same OTF measurement for an acquisition with 
a different pixelsize or in super resolution applications.
