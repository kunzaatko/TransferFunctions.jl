The base type for any transfer function is TransferFunction and further disambiguates to MeasuredTransferFunction and ModelTransferFunction.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAll of the models assume incoherent illumination sources (i.e. where the radiation from the source is inocoherent). This is an approximation for most optical setups, but one that is used almost universally (e.g. in fluorescence microscopy).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#TransferFunctions.BornWolf","page":"Home","title":"TransferFunctions.BornWolf","text":"Born & Wolf model of the transfer function for a circular aperture.\n\nParameters\n\nλ::Unitful.Length: (emission) wavelength \nnᵢ::Number: index of refraction of the immersion medium\nNA::Number: numerical aperture\n\nExtended help\n\nThe Born & Wolf model is a scalar diffraction model derived for perfect systems. It assumes that the only aberration of the system is due to defocus. Modern microscope objectives are designed to provide optimal imaging conditions for sources located directly on the coverslip, in which case the Born & Wolf model is applicable (if the coverslip and immersion is used as designed). The model disregards spherical and higher order aberrations that are due to the source of illumination being shifted from the coverslip boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#TransferFunctions.GibsonLanni","page":"Home","title":"TransferFunctions.GibsonLanni","text":"Gibson & Lanni model of the transfer function for a circular aperture.\n\nParameters\n\nExtended help\n\nThe Gibson & Lanni model is assumes that, disregarding defocus, all observed aberrations are generated by factors external to the objective (i.e. originating in the sample, coverslip and immersion medium combination). These aberrations can be characterized by the optical path difference between a ray in a perfect system (see BornWolf) and a ray under experimental conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#TransferFunctions.MeasuredPSF","page":"Home","title":"TransferFunctions.MeasuredPSF","text":"MeasuredPSF holds an array of measured data with information about the dimensions of the measurement. This allows you to make conversions to other representations of a transfer function such as an OTF and to use interpolations to sample the PSF at arbitrary locations not included in the initial measurement (in general to use the measurements  similarly to how one could use a model). This can be useful for using the same PSF measurement for an acquisition with  a different pixelsize or in super resolution applications.\n\nA measurement can be done for example using an image of subresolution microspheres.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#TransferFunctions.MeasuredTransferFunction","page":"Home","title":"TransferFunctions.MeasuredTransferFunction","text":"An abstract type for the measurement of the transfer function of an optical system.
