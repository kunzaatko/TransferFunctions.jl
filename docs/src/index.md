_Transfer functions for optical systems_

## Package Features

!!! note
    If you want to know more about the model of image formation in optical systems (cameras, microscopes, etc.) see
    [theory](@ref "Theory Overview") section.

- Generate OTF, PSF, MTF or PTF from a model or measured data
- Convert between OTF and PSF for models and measurements
- Models of transfer functions (OTF and PSF)
- Define a transfer function from its Zernicke coefficients <!-- TODO:  -->
- Estimate the Zernicke coefficients for a measured transfer function <!-- TODO: -->
